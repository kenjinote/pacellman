I have unpacked this with my [VBA-IDE-Code-Export](https://github.com/spences10/VBA-IDE-Code-Export) tool, if you want to have the binary go to the releases and download it from [there](https://github.com/spences10/pacellman/releases/tag/1.0.0).

This was made in Microsoft Excel 2003, an awesome achievement!

There is a link to the site [VBA Action game](http://www1.plala.or.jp/chikada/index.htm)

Heres a pic of the site:

This looks like a great resource if you want more retro games, also Nathan linked a book for VBA Game creation, looks to be a bargain @~Â£76 :+1:
